### Introduction:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this online documentation is to capture the materials that I have worked on and concepts I have mastered. The concepts will be listed under the topics section of the sidebar. Each concept will be explained to the best of my abilities. The concepts may include a link to a Jupyter notebook or provide example code to display the programming approach to the concept. The weekly logs will outline the general tasks that I have worked on from week to week.
